## The Goal:
Create or update the `ROADMAP.md` for the current repository. The goal is to produce a visionary, integration-oriented plan that categorizes features from **"Core Essentials"** to **"God Level"** ambition.

---

## The Input Data (CRITICAL):
- **Scan the Source Code**: Analyze the current codebase to understand what features are already implemented.
- **Scan Existing Documentation**: Look at the existing `ROADMAP.md` (if it exists), `TODO.md`, or the `README.md`.

---

## The "Smart Roadmap" Strategy:
- **Status Check**: If a feature listed in an old roadmap is found in the code, mark it as Completed `[x]`.
- **Gap Analysis**: If the code implies a feature is half-finished, move it to **Phase 1**.
- **Expansion**: Use your **"God Level"** creativity to suggest features I haven't thought of yet, based on the project type.

---

## The Structure (Categorize features into these specific Phases):

### Phase 1: Foundation (CRITICALLY MUST HAVE)
**Focus**: Core functionality, stability, security, and basic usage.  
**Instruction**: Prioritize items that are partially built or standard for this type of tool.

### Phase 2: The Standard (MUST HAVE)
**Focus**: Feature parity with top competitors, user experience improvements, and robust error handling.

### Phase 3: The Ecosystem (INTEGRATION & SHOULD HAVE)
**Focus**: Webhooks, API exposure, 3rd party plugins, SDK generation, and extensibility.  
**Instruction**: Suggest specific integrations relevant to my code (e.g., if it's a database tool, suggest ORM plugins).

### Phase 4: The Vision (GOD LEVEL)
**Focus**: **"Futuristic"** features, AI integration, advanced automation, and industry-disrupting capabilities.  
**Instruction**: Ensure these are technically plausible but highly ambitious.

### The Sandbox (OUT OF THE BOX / OPTIONAL)
**Focus**: Wild, creative, experimental ideas that set the project apart.

## Output Requirements:
- Use professional Markdown formatting.
- Use Checkboxes:  
  `- [ ]` for Todo,  
  `- [x]` for Completed.
- **Timelines**: Include estimated timelines (e.g., **Q1, Q2**) for phases.

---

## Constraint:
Do not remove existing items from the old roadmap unless they are obsolete; instead, reorganize them into this new structure.
